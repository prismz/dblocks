dblocks
-------

Status program written in C for dwm. Depends on the X11 development libraries.
Every element is in the configuration file by default, simply change them as
you wish.

To compile, run `make`. To install, run `make install` as root. By default, the
program will be installed to /usr/local/bin.

arguments:
	-s/--stdout                make the program print to stdout instead of
					setting the X11 root window name.


Adding elements is simple - add them into a .c file in `elements`, add the
function declaration to `elements.h` (functions must return char * that can
be freed.)

TODO:
- better volume
- proper lm-sensors support
